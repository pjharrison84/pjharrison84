👋 Hi, I’m @pjharrison84 <br>
👀 I’m interested in teaching best practices to a new group of developers and constantly expand my own skill set.<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning how to manage better, teach more efficiently, and capacitor/cordova/angular/c#/.net core<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that interest me.
